To ensure that the code, programs, or software that I write is functional and secure I use industry standard best practices and principles.  This allows all the programs that I write to be functional and secure, which is what employers would like to see out in industry.  To interpret users needs and incorporate them into the program many different techniques are used.  A few of the best techniques to gather requests from users are through interviews, specification documents, and any other information that is relevant to the project.  The most important approach that I take when designing software is to first solve the problem at hand, and then design a software application after the problem is solved.  This gives more focus on both tasks separately, rather than trying to solve the problem and write the code at the same time.  In the end, a more desirable product will be delivered to the customer that will also be functional and secure.
